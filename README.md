# Data Visualization Project
# Marketing Campaign Predictive Model

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model that will optimize the profit for an upcoming marketing campaign. The dataset used for this analysis is available on Kaggle:

📂 **[Marketing Campaign Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rodsaldanha/arketing-campaign)**

The goal is to analyze past campaign data, build a model that predicts customer responses, and determine the optimal percentage of customers to contact to maximize profit.

## 📄 Deliverables
- 📘 **Python Jupyter Notebook** containing the data analysis and predictive modeling.
- 📊 **Business Presentation (PDF format)** with insights, graphical visualizations, and recommendations.

## 📌 Key Tasks & Objectives
1. **📊 Data Analysis & Insights**
   - Perform exploratory data analysis.
   - Compute key descriptive statistics.
   
2. **🗂️ Market Segmentation**
   - Apply **Self-Organizing Maps (Kohonen Maps)** for customer segmentation.
   - Apply **K-mean**.
   
3. **🤖 Predictive Modeling**
   - Compare two different predictive models for the target variable **Response**.
   - Use graphical techniques to compare model performance.
   
4. **📈 Profit Optimization**
   - Compare the two models using the **profit curve**.
   - Determine the optimal percentage of customers to contact to maximize campaign profits.

## 🔑 Key Variables
- 🎯 **Target Variable**: `Response`
- 💰 **Cost per Contact**: `Z_CostContact`
- 📈 **Revenue per Positive Response**: `Z_Revenue`

## 📂 File Naming Convention
- 📝 **Code Notebook**: `marketing_campaign_analysis.ipynb`
- 📑 **Business Presentation**: `yourteam.pdf`


## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- 🐍 **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- 🎨 **Canva** (for business presentation)
